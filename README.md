Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Neural Networks in PyTorch

This project focuses on building a robust classifier to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. Using a neural network implemented in PyTorch, the model was trained and evaluated to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The project includes comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, identify and handle class imbalances, and perform necessary data preprocessing steps.

After preparing the dataset, a neural network was designed with layers optimized for the classification task. The model was trained over 100 epochs, with both training and validation loss and accuracy tracked to monitor the modelâ€™s performance. The results show that the model achieved high accuracy, effectively distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

The project concludes with a detailed evaluation of the model on a separate test set. The evaluation includes a confusion matrix and a classification report, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall, which is critical for minimizing financial loss due to fraud.

This project successfully demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in fraud detection, providing insights into model performance and the challenges associated with imbalanced datasets.
